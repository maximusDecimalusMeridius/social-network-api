## Description

This was a NoSQL/MongoDB class project to create a social network API.  Models include users, thoughts, and reactions with the ability to add and delete friends.  Mongoose is used as the ODM.

In this API, you can:

### Users

- Get a user by ID
- Create a user
- Update a user
- Delete a User

### Thoughts
- Get all thoughts
- Get a thought by ID
- Create a thought

### Friends

- Delete a friend

### BONUS
- When a user is deleted, so are all of their thoughts.
